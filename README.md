Leveraging Network Data into Insights

This project analyzes network traffic data to detect anomalies, optimize network performance, and enhance security using machine learning and data visualization techniques. It utilizes packet capture (PCAP) files 
from Wireshark and Cisco Packet Tracer, applying deep learning models for predictive analytics.
